# Router (Advanced)

This router build on the previous SPA-like one, but does not require a server-side component,
and works if the user does not have JavaScript.

It also loads content over XHR rather than baking it into the page.

### Disclaimer

This repo is only used to host the `router-advanced` sample so anyone can try it directly in a browser. No change has been done to the original code.
